Step-by-Step Guide: Creating and Connecting Three Scenes in Flash 8

Step 1: Create a New Flash Document
Open Macromedia Flash 8.

Create a new Flash file (File → New → Flash Document).

Step 2: Add Three Scenes
Go to Window → Other Panels → Scene (to open the Scene panel).

You’ll see Scene 1 by default.

Click the “+” (Add Scene) button twice to create two more scenes.

Rename the scenes:

Scene 1 → "Home"

Scene 2 → "About"

Scene 3 → "Contact"

To rename a scene, double-click its name in the Scene panel.

Step 3: Design Each Scene
Go to Scene 1 ("Home"):

Add a title: "Welcome to Home Page".

Create a button → Convert it to a Button Symbol (F8 → Button).

Set the instance name → next_btn.

Go to Scene 2 ("About"):

Add text: "This is the About Page".

Add a Next Button (instance name: next_btn).

Add a Back Button (instance name: back_btn).

Go to Scene 3 ("Contact"):

Add text: "This is the Contact Page".

Add a Back Button (instance name: back_btn).

Step 4: Add ActionScript 2.0 Code for Scene Navigation
Click on Frame 1 of Scene 1.

Open the Actions Panel (Window → Actions).

Add the following code:

actionscript

// Scene 1: Home → Go to About Page
next_btn.onRelease = function() {
    gotoAndPlay("About", 1);
};.

Now, go to Scene 2, select Frame 1, and enter this code:

actionscript

// Scene 2: About → Go to Contact Page
next_btn.onRelease = function() {
    gotoAndPlay("Contact", 1);
};

// Back to Home Scene
back_btn.onRelease = function() {
    gotoAndPlay("Home", 1);
};

Finally, go to Scene 3, select Frame 1, and add:

actionscript

// Scene 3: Contact → Back to About Page
back_btn.onRelease = function() {
    gotoAndPlay("About", 1);
};

Step 5: Test Your Scene Navigation
Press Ctrl + Enter (Control → Test Movie).

Click the Next and Back buttons to navigate between the three scenes.
